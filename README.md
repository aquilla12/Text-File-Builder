# Text-File-Builder
This notepad-like application allows you to save many text files in quick succession, using a minimal number of clicks.

## Instructions
Once you set a save directory, the application will save files to that directory on a single click.
Use the `Title` textbox to specify your desired file name, no need to include the `.txt`. If a file of that name already exists in the save diectory, the application will warn you before overwriting.
The `Logs` tab records all successful saves for your convenience.
After each save the editor is automatically cleared, ready for a new input.
